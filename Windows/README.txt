/!\ YOU HAVE TO INSTALL GOOGLE CHROME : https://www.google.fr/chrome/ AND CHROME WEBDRIVER : https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads, 

PLACE IT IN YOUR DOWNLOADS AS "C:/Users/yoursessionname/Downloads/chromedriver_win32/chromedriver.exe /!\

Then, write in your shell 'pip install requirement.txt' 

A little cheat for 10 fast fingers.com :D (only in french for the moment)

You can change the "options.binary_location" with your chrome binary option, the "path" with your chrome webdriver path.
But i recommand you to use the normal installation and don't change the path :p
