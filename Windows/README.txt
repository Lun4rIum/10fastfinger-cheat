/!\ YOU HAVE TO INSTALL GOOGLE CHROME IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT : https://www.google.fr/chrome/ /!\

Then, write in your shell 'pip install -r requirement.txt' 

A little cheat for 10 fast fingers.com :D (only in french for the moment)

You can change the "options.binary_location" with your chrome binary option.
But i recommand you to use the normal installation and don't change the path :p
