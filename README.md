A little cheat for 10 fast fingers.com :D (only in french for the moment)

For the moment, it only works with my computer because i'm doing some test, but soon, you'll be able to use it.

Or you can change the "options.binary_location" with your chrome binary option, the "path" with your chrome webdriver path.
Select your OS for the download !!!
